#Discover Platform.sh

Platform.sh is a managed and automated high-availability hosting platform for
PHP.

Platform.sh is a second generation PaaS powered by a highly available grid of
micro-containers. The developer pushes code, and we automatically put
everything into production.

Our job is to make developers' lives easier, and to practically eliminate all
sysadmin chores.We can create staging and development environments on-the-fly
that are precise copies of production with even the same data as production.
And we can do so in 30 seconds.

We deploy databases and configure the lot with no sysadmin work: None, zero..
Itâ€™s fully automated and happens almost instantly. Platform.sh cuts out the
middle-man between your code and deployment.

The [User Guide](../user_guide/) will give you detailed technical information
about how Platform.sh operates, how to configure every aspect of it, use
multiple applications in the same project, configure and use search engines and
caches or integrate with external services such as GitHub, Bitbucket or
Blackfire.
