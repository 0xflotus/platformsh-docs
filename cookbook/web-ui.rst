======

.. _user_add:

Add a Platform.sh user 
----------------------

See `user administration <https://docs.platform.sh/using-platform/005-user-administration.html>`_.

There are two configuration icons on the Platform UI - one for the project and one for the environment. The project configuration icon is next to the project name, in the upper left corner of the project page.

* Hover over the project configuration icon. The description appears. 
* Click the icon. The access control page appears. 
* Click the Add user button. A form appears. 
* Fill in the fields. 
* Save your work. An invitation is sent to the new user. 



.. _project_rename:

rename an environment
---------------------

You can rename an :term:`environment` by clicking its name on the Platform UI. 

.. figure:: /use-platform.sh/images/renaming-environment.png
  :alt: Renaming environment

  For example, you can rename the ``Master`` :term:`environment` into ``Live``.

.. note::
    This will not change the associated Git branch name.


.. _project_launch:

Go live
-------

When you are ready to launch your website, there are couple of steps that you must do to point your own domain to your Platform site.

.. rubric:: Add the domain to your Project

First, you need to make sure that your domain has been added to Platform.

  .. image:: /use-platform.sh/getting-started/images/icon-configure.png
    :alt: Configure icon
    :align: left

  | Click the top-most **configure** icon next to the project name. Select the **Domains** tab.
  | Add your domain and save it (check wildcard if you would like all subdomains to default here).

.. note::
  If you're running on a Development plan, you will need to upgrade it to a live included plan (Standard or more).




.. _env_delete_web:

Delete an environment (or branch) in Platform.sh 
------------------------------------------------

Delete environment code
- Select the environment
- deactivate the environment (Configure > Deactivate this environment)
These steps remove the various components (app, database and so on) but does not touch the environment configuration. This config is used to rebuild the child environment based on its parent.
