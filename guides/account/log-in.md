# Authenticate locally using the Platform.sh CLI

The [Platform.sh CLI](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli) will
authenticate you with Platform.sh and show your projects. Just type this
command to start:

```bash
platform
```

The credentials you enter are the same as your [Platform.sh account](https://accounts.platform.sh/user).

> **note**
> If you have created your account using the  oAuth Login (bitbucket, github or google) in order to use the Platform CLI you
> will need to setup a password which you can do by visiting this page [https://accounts.platform.sh/user/password](https://accounts.platform.sh/user/password)
