# Synching and moving data 
Platform.sh customers can use sftp, rsynch and Drush to move files and DBs between the cloud and their local environments. 

Platform.sh provides interactive on-server Drush access via the platform drush command.
Database dumps and syncs are also made very simple using the 
platform environment:synchronize and platform environment:sql-dump commands.
