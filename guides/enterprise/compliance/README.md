# Compliance

## ISO 27001
ISO 27001 is a security management standard that specifies security management best practices and comprehensive security controls following the ISO 27002 best practice guidance. This is a widely-recognized international security standard in which our customers showed significant interest. Certification in the standard requires us to:
Systematically evaluate our information security risks, taking into account the impact of company threats and vulnerabilities
Design and implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls and other forms of risk management to address company and architecture security risks
Adopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls meet the our information security needs on an ongoing basis
The AWS ISO 27001 certification can be downloaded here.
The key to the ongoing certification under this standard is the effective management of a rigorous security program. The Information Security Management System (ISMS) required under this standard defines how we perpetually manage security in a holistic, comprehensive way. The ISO 27001 certification is specifically focused on the AWS ISMS and measures how our internal processes follow the ISO standard. Certification means a third party accredited independent auditor has performed an assessment of our processes and controls and confirms they are operating in alignment with the comprehensive ISO 27001 certification standard.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
This standard was established by the payment card industry to ensure compliance in several areas including security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design, and other critical protective measures. This comprehensive standard is intended to help organizations proactively protect customer account data.
At the infrastructure and datacenter layers, AWS complies fully with the PCI DSS Level 1. Customers with sites on Platform.sh can leverage the PCI accreditation of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to build PCI compliant sites. All Platform.sh sites with e-commerce capabilities use third-party credit card processors, embedding secure payment forms within the site so that credit card data is sent directly from the end user to the credit card processor. Since credit card data is not stored on sites implementing e-commerce in this way the PCI compliance requirements are minimal and entail completing a PCI self-assessment questionnaire and semi-annual security scans. Customers should check with their credit card processors on what level of PCI compliance is required.

Platform.SH does not store credit card data when customers use credit cards to procure our services.
