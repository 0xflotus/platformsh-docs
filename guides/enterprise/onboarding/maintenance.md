# Maintenance

[//]: # (TODO: Hardware maintenance) 

## System maintenance and downtime 
System maintenance is occasionally required to improve or correct issues involving the platform. They do not, however, systematically require downtime for our customers, and in some cases this can be avoided if the customer remains logged in to their Platform.sh UI.

Downtime is avoided as much as possible, and when it is unavoidable we prioritize scheduling it during off-business hours for EST/GMT/CET time zones.

## Scheduled maintenance 
Our policy regarding system maintenance and downtime is to provide notification one week in advance of the scheduled outage in the form of an email which provides the following information:
- when the outage will occur and its duration (date and time zones EST/CET)
- who is affected by the outage (which clusters/customers)
- how the outage is affecting them (eg: Access to Platform.sh UI temporarily unavailable if the user has not already logged in.)
- why the outage is occurring 

There may also be a banner on the Platform.sh website to notify customers who may not have seen the email.

##Emergency maintenance 

**Request Methods**
In the event of an emergency, customers can submit a support ticket to us through several different methods:
- Email us at ops@commerceguys.com with “P1Platform” or “P1Application” in the subject depending on if the issue is Platform.sh related or site code related. In the body of the message, please provide the following information:
  - your email associated with the Platform.sh account if different from the one you’re using to send the support request
  - your Platform.sh account id if you have it
  - A short summary of the problem the user is facing
  - A short overview of the steps required to re-create the issue
  - Any related screenshots or error messages
- Submit a ticket to us from the Platform.sh UI by clicking on the “Support” menu in the upper right corner of any Platform.sh project page. Use the Submit ticket menu item to navigate to the Platform.sh support form and provide the same information requested in bullet 1) above.

**Response Times**
Depending on your subscription, the response time will vary:
- Enterprise customers:
  - P1 tickets: 2hrs or less from reception of your support request in the ticket system.
  - P2 tickets: 4hrs or less from reception of your support request in the ticket system.
  - P3 tickets: best effort
- Standard customers:
  - P1 tickets: 4hrs or less from reception of your support request in the ticket system.
  - P2 tickets: 1 business day or less from reception of your support request in the ticket system.
  - P3 tickets: best effort
