# Onboarding procedures

An onboarding discussion will be planned with customers to accomplish several goals:
- Introduce team members to each other and understand roles and responsibilities of both parties
- Discuss support interactions (how to submit tickets)
- Discuss priority definitions (how to discriminate p1, from p2, from p3)
- Discuss escalation paths and methods
- Identify risks around the project 
  - customer-facing uat or demos, 
  - special go-live procedures, 
  - marketing and important schedules to be aware of
  - critical-to-business functionality discussion
For contracts including application support, a site audit is also included in this process allowing our teams to fully understand the site functionality.

**Onboarding Team** 
- Development workflow consultation - Based on your input a Platform.sh consultant will examine your current workflow and make proposals on how to optimize your development for Platform.sh Enterprise. This of course includes making sure you actually know how to use the intended Platform.sh workflows to your maximum advantage.
- Assistance with initial code migration - A Platform.sh consultant will work with your team to move your code from your current provider to your Platform.sh Enterprise git repository.
Assistance with deployment - Our onboarding team will work with you deploy your site on Platform.sh Enterprise. This may require effort in terms of upgrading modules, adding PHP libraries or modifying configuration files and settings. 

**Launch Team** 
- Pre-launch risk assessment - In a screensharing session, our team will work with you to uncover risks attached to your business case, any special needs and critical timing. Output: An email containing risks identified and proposed steps for mitigation on the timeline to launch.
- SSL certificate consultation - Correctly installing and configuring SSL certificates is often a headache when migrating a site to a new platform. Our team will help you to make this happen with a minimum of fuss. 
- DNS/CDN consultation - We will work with you to ensure that your DNS is correctly configured (in particular making sure that ALIAS records that map TLDs to CDN hostnames are in place), and that assets are being correctly cached in our CDN. 
Domains and redirects - The Platform.sh team will help with your migration, setting up redirects  and ensuring your domains are available upon DNS cutover, including any wildcard and subdomains.
- Dedicated support window on launch day - In preparation for launch we will have dedicated support resources available to monitor your go-live and work with you to iron out any real-time issues as they occur.
