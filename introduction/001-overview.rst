What is Platform?
-----------------
Platform is a **cloud-based hosting environment** tuned for eCommerce, but suitable for any Drupal project.

How does it work?
-----------------
Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides an accelerated and highly automated environment within which Drupal-centric projects are developed, tested and delivered into production, including non-LAMP stack components and custom services. This is both a significant value and paradigm shift for developers, offering optimized site infrastructure and requiring 25% less system administration effort. As the size and complexity of a site on Platform scales up, so do the savings.

In addition, Platform’s functionality solves many of the issues that plague common hosting environments:

* Automated environment management provides a Git-driven development process that **reduces the amount of developer effort required**. With this functionality, users can branch and merge at will to develop even the smallest feature, or test an urgent security fix, all against a cloned (identical) copy of the upstream/live environment.

* Platform’s infrastructure **eliminates issues resulting from inconsistencies between environments** by allowing developers to work with site clones.

* Platform **reduces system administration costs**. With the ability to quickly create, destroy, and easily manage new environments, System Administrators focus less on maintenance and more on developing and moving business forward.

What's unique about Platform?
-----------------------------
Platform is **built around a Continuous Integration model**, so features and fixes can be integrated quickly and easily, rather than forcing delays waiting for scheduled batch deployments. That means less waiting for code changes to go live, whether they be tiny tweaks or brand new functionality.
