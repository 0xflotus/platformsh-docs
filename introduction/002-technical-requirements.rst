Technical Requirements & Recommendations
========================================

.. todo:: Blurb about requirements/recommendations on Platform. Generic. Minimal requirements should be emphasized. Maybe a bit about why Platform uses Git.

Requirements
------------

The only technical requirements for developing on Platform are **Git** and **SSH**.

.. rubric:: Git

:ref:`Git <git>` is the version control system used by Platform. You will need to have it installed to be able to interact with your codebase on Platform.

.. rubric:: SSH

:ref:`SSH <ssh>` public/private keypair is required to interact with Platform using :ref:`Git <git>`.

.. seealso::
   * :ref:`Generating an SSH keypair <ssh_genkeypair>`

Recommendations
---------------

.. rubric:: Platform CLI

Commerce Guys has developed the :ref:`Platform CLI <cli>` to give you the ability to use and manage all of your Platform projects from the command line, including branching, merging, performing backups, etc.

You can download it from `Github <https://github.com/commerceguys/platform-cli>`_ and installing it locally following the installation steps detailed on Github.
