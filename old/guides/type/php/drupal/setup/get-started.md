# Getting Started with Drupal

Platform.sh has unparalleled Drupal support (it was created by Commerce Guys after all!).

We encapsulate as much as possible the best practices for working with Drupal, which basically means using a Drush make file and exporting features to code. Doing this carries a great many benefits we will not go into now... it keeps your codebase small, you get everything updated automatically, it's both faster and safer and makes unicorns dance.

But we also allow for other styles: you can develop and deploy using
installation profiles in "profile mode".. or by simply committing the whole code tree including core and contrib modules (what we call "Vanilla mode").

Platform.sh supports any Drupal version.

Let's dive in.
