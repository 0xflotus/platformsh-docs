Technical Requirements
======================

.. todo:: Blurb about requirements/recommendations on Platform. Generic. Minimal requirements should be emphasized. Maybe a bit about why Platform uses Git.


The only technical requirements for developing on Platform are **Git** and **SSH**.

git
---

:ref:`Git <git>` is the version control system used by Platform. You will need to have it installed to be able to interact with your codebase on Platform.


SSH
---

:ref:`SSH <ssh>` public/private keypair is required to interact with Platform using :ref:`Git <git>`.

.. seealso::
   * :ref:`Generating an SSH keypair <ssh_genkeypair>`


the Platform.sh CLI
-------------------

Commerce Guys has developed *platform*, the :ref:`Platform CLI <cli>`. *Platform* gives you the ability to use and manage all of your Platform projects from the command line, including branching, merging and performing backups.

Download it from `Github <https://github.com/commerceguys/platform-cli>`_. 
Install *platform* following the steps in the Github readme.
