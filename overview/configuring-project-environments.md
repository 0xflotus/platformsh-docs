# Configuring your Project

There are two levels to the configuration of your Platform.sh project:

1. One touches the configuration for everything that is global to the same project - the applications and services that make your project
2. The other touches each different environment  for this project (so your live production environment is one, a testing environment, or a development environment would be others)

You can configure many aspects of Platform.sh through the web interface and
through the CLI. However, your application, services, and routes configurations
are stored in files that live in your Git repository.
