Command Line Interface (CLI)
============================

What is the CLI?
----------------

The cli is the official tool to use and manage your Platform.sh projects
directly from your terminal. Anything you can do in the Platform UI can
be done with the cli.


What can I do with the CLI?
---------------------------

The cli uses the platform\_api to trigger commands (*Branch, Merge...*)
on your Platform.sh project.

It's also very useful when you work locally since it can simulate a
local build of your codebase as if you were pushing a change to
Platform.sh.

Once you have the cli installed, run `platform list` to see all of the
available commands.
