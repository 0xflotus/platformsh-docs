Technical Requirements
======================

Platform.sh will require you to have **Git** installed. You also need to be familiar with **SSH**.

Git
---

:ref:`Git <git>` is the version control system used by Platform.sh. You need to have it installed to be able to interact with your codebase on Platform.sh.

.. seealso::
   * `Install Git <http://www.git-scm.com/>`_

SSH
---

You will need a :ref:`SSH <ssh>` public/private keypair in order to interact with Platform.sh. Your public key is upladed to your Platform.sh user account, and it then governs authentication for  :ref:`Git <git>`, SSH sessions (shell access), and other tools that connect to your Platform.sh project.

.. seealso::
   * :ref:`Generating an SSH keypair <ssh_genkeypair>`


The Platform.sh CLI
-------------------

Platform.sh offers a dedicated :ref:`Command Line Interface (CLI) <cli>` tool. The :ref:`Command Line Interface (CLI) <cli>` allows you to use and manage all of your projects directly from your terminal.

You can download the :ref:`Command Line Interface (CLI) <cli>` from `Github <https://github.com/commerceguys/platform-cli>`_.
