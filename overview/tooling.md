# Great Tooling

Our job is to make developers and teams more productive, so we spent a lot of
time not only in making Platform.sh a very robust hosting environment but also
a very easy one to use.

## Command Line Interface

We offer a feature rich CLI that allows you to manage and automate every aspect
of Platform.sh. 

A developer could use Platform.sh without ever having to open the Web Interface.

## Clean and Lean Web Interface

You can configure most aspects of Platform.sh using our simple Web Interface
Even a non-technical user can create new environments,  can set-up
access-control, map domains and manage users.

A project manager could use Platform.sh without ever opening the command-line.

## Git

Everything in Platform.sh is managed through Git. You can simply modify a couple
of configuration files and manage almost all aspects of operations that way.

A developer could use Platform.sh without ever installing our CLI.

## Seamless Bitbucket and Github integrations

We have perfectly seamless integrations for both Bitbucket and Github. You can
login to platform with your Bitbucket or Github account. And you can have
Platform.sh environments be automatically created for every pull-request or 
branch you create.. and get feedback on deployments right there without 
switching tools.

A developer could use Platform.sh without even knowing its there. 

They just get automatic staging environments.  Which is how the whole
feature-branch thing was always supposed to work.
