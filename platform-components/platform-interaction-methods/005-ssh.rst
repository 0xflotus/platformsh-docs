SSH
###

Platform uses SSH for authentication. You will need to have a public / private keypair in order to interact with your project(s) codebase and to be able to SSH into your :term:`environments <environment>` web servers.

.. _ssh_genkeypair:

Generate your Public / Private Keypair
**************************************

1. You might already have existing SSH keys on your computer. Open up a command prompt and run the following commands. ::

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ ls -a
    id_rsa
    id_rsa.pub
    known_hosts
    authorized_keys

   If you have a file named either ``id_rsa.pub`` or ``id_dsa.pub``, you already have SSH key on your computer and you don't need to perform the actions outlined in step 2.

2. If you arrived at this step and don't have SSH keys, this step will walk you through creating them. The following command will initiate that process. ::

     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email_address@example.com"

   ``ssh-keygen`` generates the key pair and will ask you where you want to save the file. ::

     Generating public/private rsa key pair.
     Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa):

   The default location is fine, in most cases. Now it's time to create a passphrase. A good, strong passphrase is highly recommended! ::

     Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
     Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

   That's it. Keys generated! Here are the results. ::

     Your identification has been saved in /Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa.
     Your public key has been saved in /Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
     The key fingerprint is:
     55:c5:d7:a9:1f:dc:7a:67:31:70:fd:87:5a:a6:d0:69 your_email_address@example.com

   .. note:: Make note of the location of your public key, you're going to need that in the next section.

.. _ssh_addkeytoaccount:

Add your SSH key to your Platform account
*****************************************

You have your SSH keys (if not, take a look at the section above), but you need to make sure Platform has a copy of your public key. It's pretty easy to add it to your account.

1. First off, you'll need to copy your public key to the clipboard.

2. Head over to your user account page on `Marketplace <https://marketplace.commerceguys.com/user>`_ and navigate to the ``SSH Keys`` tab.

3. Click on the ``Add a public key`` link.

4. Paste the key that you copied earlier into the 'Key' text box and you can add a title, if you like (it will be auto-generated, if you don't add one).

5. Click 'Save'. That's it! You're all set. Now you'll be able to use :ref:`Git <git>` on Platform, as well as, be able to SSH into one of your :term:`environments <environment>` web servers, if you need too.

.. _ssh_towebservers:

SSH into Web Servers
********************

Just under the Environment indicator, in the Platform UI, there is a link to the access information for that :term:`environment`. Click on this link to view access information about this :term:`environment`.

You can copy the SSH command (shown in the figure below) and paste it into your terminal to SSH into the web server for this :term:`environment`.

.. figure:: /platform-components/platform-interaction-methods/images/ssh-access-information.png
   :alt: SSH access information

   The SSH user name is the concatenation of the your platforms unique id and the environment id. The ssh hostname is 'ssh.' prepended onto the server clusters hostname your platform is hosted on. I.E.: [project-id]-[environment-id]@ssh.[server-cluster-hostname].
