Mastering the Basics - Part 1
=============================

Once you've purchased a Platform package, you will be automatically redirected to your new Platform account. You can access your existing Platform accounts through your `Commerce Guys Marketplace account <https://marketplace.commerceguys.com/user>`_. Once you've logged in, click on the "Platforms" tab on your user account page. You will find a list of platform projects with links to each of them.

Install Kickstart / Drupal / Empty Git
--------------------------------------

  :alt: Platform Setup

  The first time you access the :ref:`platform_ui`, you'll see the project setup wizard which helps you to configure your project.

Choose a name for your project (this could be the domain of the site you are working on) and then choose a starting point:

* **Commerce Kickstart**: The quickest way to get up and running with Drupal Commerce.
* **Drupal 7**: Standard Drupal 7 installation profile.
* **From scratch**: Empty Git repository. Choose this option if you are migrating an existing site.

Once youâ€™re done, Platform will build your project and provide you a default :term:`environment` called :term:`Master`.

.. note::
   Choosing either 'Commerce Kickstart' or 'Drupal 7' will cause Platform to generate a :term:`make file` in the root of your repository. This :term:`make file` will be used to build your site.

First look at Platform
----------------------

  :alt: Platform UI

  Once you've completed your project setup, you will be sent to your new project page. Now you can start working with Platform!

  1. **Project selection and configuration -** Switch between projects, or manage the configurations of the current project. Changing the project here will update everything below it to the current project.
  2. **Account administration, support, and documentation-** Use these quick access links to documentation resources, support options, or your current user account information.
  3. **Environment indicator, access information, and configuration-** This will tell you which environment (or branch) you are currently working in. The configuration icon and website link will apply specifically to this environment.
  4. **Git branch, synchronize, merge, and backups-** These primary actions are used for your regular development workflow for the specific environment. Read more about these actions in the :ref:`platform_ui` section.
  5. **Environment selector-** Switch between environment contexts. When you create a new branch by clicking the branch action link, those environemtns will appear here. Selecting an environment here will change everything to the right of this to that environment's context.
  6. **Environment activity stream-** Follow the latest activity for the current environment.

The **configuration icon** is a contextual link. It will direct you to the configuration settings for either the current :term:`project` or :term:`environment` that you are viewing.

Access Your Site
----------------
Each :term:`environment` has its own URL that you can access by clicking *View this website* under its name.

You can administer the Settings, Variables, Routes, and Users specifically for each :term:`environment` by clicking the **configuration icon** here.

--------

Branch an Environment
---------------------
When you :term:`branch` an :term:`environment`, you create a new :term:`environment` which is an exact copy of its parent (*including files, database and services*).

During a :term:`branch` operation, Platform freezes the parent :term:`environment` and takes a snapshot. Then the parent :term:`environment` is released and the child :term:`environment` is built using the snapshot.

To :term:`branch` an environment, click the `Branch` icon on the top right of the :term:`Platform UI` and give it a name (for example: *Sprint1*).

  * :ref:`best_practices`

Clone the codebase with Git
---------------------------

You might not need to *run* a copy of your :term:`environment` locally, but you will most likely want to be able to add code to your project. To do that, you need to clone a copy of the codebase for your :term:`environment` down to your local system using Git. If you *do* want to run a copy of your environment locally, you will probably want to do so with a copy of the database from this :term:`environment`.

.. note::
   Make sure you have Git installed and you have uploaded your public SSH key prior to running this command. See the :ref:`technical_requirements` for more information.

One of the first elements you'll see at the top of the Platform interface is a "PULL | CLONE" text widget. You can use the commands listed there to clone the branch you are currently viewing.

.. figure:: /quick-start-guide/images/pull-clone-copy.png
  :alt: Pull or Clone your repository

  Select **CLONE** on the widget and copy the command listed in the adjacent text box. It should start with 'git clone'.

If you haven't added an :term:`SSH key` to your user account, you will see a notice to do so. Add your SSH keys through the `Commerce Guys Marketplace account <https://marketplace.commerceguys.com/user>`_. On your account page, click on the SSH Keys tab to add your SSH Keys.

----

In your terminal, paste the command you copied and add a name for the folder at the end of the command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone --branch [branch-name] [project-id]@git.eu.platform.sh:[project-id].git project-folder-name

Once you have cloned the branch locally, you can see the files that are contained in the Git repository.

.. note::
   * Make sure you copy your commands from the Platform interface. Bonus points if you have your platform id memorized.
