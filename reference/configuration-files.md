# Configuration files

Platform.sh stores the configuration of your applications and services in YAML files that you need to commit in your Git repository.

The configuration files are stored in Git and allow you to easily
interact with Platform.sh. You can define and configure the services you
want to deploy and use, the specific routes you need to serve your
application...

> **note**
> Find many examples for those configuration files on the [platformsh-examples repository on 
Github](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples).
