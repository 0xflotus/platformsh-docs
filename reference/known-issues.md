============

"No Application Configured"
---------------------------

If you see the `No Application Configured` when accessing your
[Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) site within a browser, this means
that the environment youâ€™re trying to access is not completely ready
yet.

Make sure it's completely built. The latest environment status on your
Platform activity stream should be marked as **Success**.
