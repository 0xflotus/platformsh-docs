# Multiple Applications Configuration

Platform.sh supports  multiple applications per project (for example  RESTful web
 services and a front-end, or a main web site and a blog).

All of the applications share a common configuration through the files present in the
`.platform/` directory at the root of the repository. But on many fronts each can
has its own configuration.

To create a multi-application setup put each application in its own directory with
an `.platform.app.yaml` at its root. When Platform.sh deploys this it will create
a service for each application.

For example if we have a project composed of a Drupal installation and a Symfony project, we would put each project in its own directory:
```bash
$ ls -a
.platform/
drupal/
symfony/
```

> ** note ** Platform.sh supports git submodules, so each project can be in a separate
> repository. This is an incredibly powerful feature.. it allows you with a single commit
> to create a "staging" server with different versions of each application.


In the symfony `.platform.app.yaml` we might have `name: phpsymfony` and in the Drupal one `name: phpdrupal` to make this work together we would put in `.platform/routes.yaml` something like the following:

```yaml
"http://{default}/myapp":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "phpsymfony:php"
"http://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: Â« phpdrupal:php"
```
This will result (if we consider we are on the http://example.com domain): http://example.com being served by the Drupal instance, while http://example.com/myapp and all the urls below it to be served by the Symfony App.

## Micro-service Multi-App example
Here is a more detailed and complete example for a project that is designed in "micro-service" style.

The directory layout may resemble something like the following:
```
.platform/
  routes.yaml
  services.yaml
user_api/
  .platform.app.yaml
  public/
    index.php
    [...]
content_api/
  .platform.app.yaml
  public/
    index.php
    [...]
front_end/
  .platform.app.yaml
  public/
    index.php
    assets/
    [...]
```
> **note** note that there is no relationship between the directories names and the 
> applications' names in Platform.sh. The names are going to get declared in the
> configuration files..


Let's imagine that in this case the Front End (front) app depends on two REST services a 
User API (user) and a Content API (content). Lets also imagine both API applications
connect to the same Postgres database. And that the Front-End  does not connect directly to
the database (it does everything through these APIs) but it does use a Redis as a Cache.

In our use case the User API is accessible through  a url like "http://api.example.com/v1/users"
and the Content API is accessible through "http://api.example.com/v1/content". In this case we are not doing http caching on the two APIs, but we are caching on the Front End applications.

The `.platform/routes.yaml` may look like:
````yaml
"http://api.{default}/v1/users":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "user:php"
    cache:
        enabled: false
"http://api.{default}/v1/content":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "content:php"
    cache:
        enabled: false
"http://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "front:php"
    cache:
        enabled: true
```

> **note** for the moment the upstream is always of this form, ending with ":php" this is 
> because, currently we only support PHP, and in the future Platform.sh will support multiple 
> endpoints per application. Here it simply tells our router to connect, for example to 
> a service we called "front" and route http traffic to the PHP service running there.

The `.platform/services.yaml` may look like:
```yaml
commondb:
    type: postgresql
    disk: 4096
cache:
    type: redis
```
Here we say that we have two services that will be potentially available to any application
in the project the, the keys "commondb" and "cache" are names we can freely (must be 
alphanumeric with no special characters) choose to describe the role theses services will 
have in our project; We will use these names in each application's `.platform.app.yaml` to 
link the service to the application.


The User API `user_api/.platform.app.yaml`  will look like the following (only putting here the relevant parts `[...]` representing the stuff we cut out...):
```
name: user
[...]
relationships:
    "database": "commondb:postgresql"
```
> Here the name "database" is freely chosen by us, this will be exposed in the 
> Environment Variables of the application (so it can be different between the different
> application of the same project). The right part "commondb:postgresql" comes from
> what we put in `services.yaml` for the name. The ":postgresql" suffix, which is required,
> is there because in the future we will support multiple endpoints per service (for 
> services that support multiple protocols). Learn more on : [services.yaml](/refernce/routes.yaml.md)

For example's Content API `content_api/.platform.app.yaml` will in this case be very similar:
```yaml
name: content
[...]
relationships:
    "database": "commondb:postgresql"
```

> **note** Here we keep the name "database" but this could be anything; This name will only
> appear in the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable of the "Content Api".

And finally the Front End `front_end/.platform.app.yaml` will look like:
```
name: front
[...]
relationships:
    "database": "cache:redis"
    "user_service": "user:php"
    "content_service": "content:php"
```

These relationships allow an application to connect to another.. and will expose in 
its Environment Variables everything that is needed for it to be used dynamically
in its configuration.

> **note** Here the names "database", "user_service" and "content_service"
> are freely chosen by us, often enough its better to keep to a simpler naming scheme.
