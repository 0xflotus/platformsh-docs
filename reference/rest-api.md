# REST API

Platform.sh exposes a **hypermedia REST API** which allows you to
interact with your project and manage your environments.

The cli and the ui are both abstraction layers which consume
this API.

The API can be used to automate all aspects of operations of
Platform.sh .. but it is currently in closed beta and
not yet generally available. If you have need for automation that 
you can not accomplish using the CLI please contact our support and
we shall provide you with beta access. But know that it has not
yet achieved its final form and may change in the near future.
