# PHP Applications

We have tested Platform.sh extensively with Drupal and Symfony applications, but its 
versatility allows it to support any PHP application (people have been running 
Wordpress, CiviCrm, Laravel Applications, Magento and Prestashop on it as well as
custom built PHP applications), in this section we provide information specific
to the configuration and operation of specific Frameworks and Toolstacks.

It is noteworthy that for Drupal and Symfony Platform.sh provides specific 
tooling to help you be more productive (through built-in composer support or 
built-in drush support).

> **note**
> Find many examples for those configuration files on the [platformsh-examples repository on 
Github](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-examples).
> with many examples for Drupal, Symfony, Custom PHP Applications (with multi apps), Wordpress, Magento, Prestashop, Laravel...
Platform.sh supports custom PHP configurations.
