# June 2016

June update is summarized in our [blog post](https://platform.sh/2016/06/new-features-june/).

## New PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY variable

New variable which has a random value, stable throughout the projectâ€™s life. 

It can be used for Drupal hash salt for example (in our [Drupal 8 example](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8)):

```
// /scripts/platformsh/dist.settings.platformsh.php

// Set the project-specific entropy value, used for generating one-time
// keys and such.
if (isset($_ENV['PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY']) && empty($settings['hash_salt'])) {
  $settings['hash_salt'] = $_ENV['PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY'];
}
```

It is [documented here](https://docs.platform.sh/development/environment-variables.html#platformsh-variables)

## Extend PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable

Expose the hostname and IP address of each service in the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable.

## Services updates

Update MongoDB client to 3.2.7, Node.js to 4.4.5, Blackfire plugin to 1.10.6, Nginx to 1.11.1.
