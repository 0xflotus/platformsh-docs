# Accessing logs

Logs for various tasks on an application container are available in the `/var/log` directory.  They can be accessed on the normal shell after loging in with `platform ssh`, or by executing a single `tail` or `cat` command via `platform ssh`, like so:

```
platform ssh 'tail /var/log/access.log'
```

A number of different log files are available depending on the application container in use.

Although the `/var/log` directory is writeable, it should not be written to directly. Only write to it via standard logging mechanisms, such as syslog or your application's logging facility.

## `access.log`

This is the raw access log for the nginx instance running on the application container. That is, it does not include any requests that return a redirect or cache hit from the [router](configuration/routes.md).

## `nginx/error.log`

nginx startup log messages will be recorded in this file.  It is rarely needed except when debugging possible nginx configuration errors.

## `error.log`

nginx-level errors that occur once nginx has fully started will be recorded here. This will include HTTP 500 errors for missing directories, file types that are excluded based on the `.platform.app.yaml` file, etc.

## `deploy.log`

The deploy log contains the output of the most recent run of the deploy hook for the container.  If there is no deploy hook then this file will be absent.

## `cron.log`

The cron log contains the output of all recent cron executions.  If there is no cron hook specified in the container configuration then this file will be absent. It also will not exist until the first time cron has run.

## `php.log`

On a PHP container, any logs generated by the PHP engine itself will be sent here.  That includes PHP Errors, Warnings, and Notices as well as uncaught exceptions.
