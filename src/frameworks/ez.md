# EZ Platform

EZ Platform is a Composer-based PHP CMS, and as such fits well with the Platform.sh model.  As a Symfony-based application its setup is very similar to Symfony.

## Configure your app

The ideal `.platform.app.yaml` file will vary from project project, and you are free to customize yours as needed.  A recommended baseline EZ Platform configuration is listed below, and can also be found in the [EZ Platform template project](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-ezplatform).
