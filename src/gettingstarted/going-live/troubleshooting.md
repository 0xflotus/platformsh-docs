# Going Live

## Done!

Now your application has been taken live!

As mentioned before, it may take a little time for the DNS to fully propagate, depending on the registrar. Otherwise, your domain should now point to the `master` production environment of your project.

If for any reason this guide has not fully taken your project live, be sure to consult the specific use cases and troubleshooting tips below.

### Additional information

If through the following steps your project did not successfully configure to your domain, you can consult the Troubleshooting guide here:

* [Going Live: Troubleshooting](/golive/troubleshoot.md)

If you would rather use a Fastly CDN than the Platform.sh router cache, you can find more information regarding how to do so in the documentation:

* [Going Live: Fastly](/golive/steps/fastly.md)

You can also use Cloudflare's TLS/SSL service to secure your site via HTTPS:
