# Start with a template

## Next steps

In this guide you created a project using the [management console](/administration/web.md) and installed the [Platform.sh CLI](/development/cli.md).

Don't stop now! There are far more features that make Platform.sh profoundly helpful to developers that you have left to explore.

### Import your own code

Templates are great, but configuring your own application to run on Platform.sh is just as easy.

<div class="buttons">
  <a href="/gettingstarted/own-code.html" class="button-link"><b>Import your own code</b><br/>Use the CLI and a few configuration files to deploy your code on Platform.sh.</a>
</div>

### Developing on Platform.sh

Once an application has been migrated to Platform.sh, there's plenty more features that will help improve your development life cycle.

<div class="buttons">
  <a href="/gettingstarted/local-development.html" class="button-link"><b>Local Development</b><br/>Remotely connect to services and build your application locally during development.</a>

  <a href="/gettingstarted/dev-environments.html" class="button-link"><b>Development environments</b><br><br>Activate development branches and test new features before merging into production.</a>
</div>
