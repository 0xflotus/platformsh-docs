# Next steps

In this guide you created a project using the [management console](/administration/web.md) and installed the [Platform.sh CLI](/development/cli.md). Now you can explore some of the next steps for working with Platform.sh.

## Import your own code

Templates are great, but configuring your own application to run on Platform.sh is the goal.

## Developing on Platform.sh

Once an application has been migrated to Platform.sh, there's plenty more features that will help improve your development life cycle.

<div class="buttons">
  <a href="/gettingstarted/local-development.html" class="button-link descriptive"><b>Local Development</b><br>Remotely connect to services and build your application locally during development.</a>

  <a href="/gettingstarted/dev-environments.html" class="button-link descriptive"><b>Development environments</b><br>Activate development branches and test new features before merging into production.</a>
