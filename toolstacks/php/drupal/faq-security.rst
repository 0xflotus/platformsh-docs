Drupal Security FAQ
===================

There is a planned Drupal security release that will be taking place on Wednesday, October 15th 2014. 


Will it affect me?
------------------
Yes. This is one of the rare patches that needs to be applied to all Drupal sites.

I’m panicking. Should I panic now? Or later? Or both?
While this announcement may sound worrisome, there’s no need to panic. It’s a rather simple procedure to fix, and we’re here to help you resolve this situation. We have a plan.

When will it affect me?
-----------------------
When the patch is released. We will be sending notifications via email and the @platformsh twitter account.

Why is this happening to me?
----------------------------
Drupal does regular security reviews for just this type of situation: They want to be sure that there are no major issues that will affect the community.

What are you doing to protect me? What do I need to do?
-------------------------------------------------------
In preparation for this release, here’s how we are responding, and how you can be ready when the patch is available:

**Enterprise Platform** customers and customers who subscribe to Platform **Enterprise Support** packages or **Application Support** customers:
Your site will be patched immediately following the release. You can make yourself a drink and toast to your enterprise coverage.

**Standard Platform customers**:
You will need to apply the patch to your site. We will be sending you an email tomorrow when the patch is available with instructions on how to do this in case you aren’t sure how.

We’ve chosen to automatically block URL’s hosted on the platform in order to prevent attacks for our production customers until your patch can be applied. 
On your development environment, it will specify that there is a security risk that should be addressed. 
On production environments, it will simply state that access is unavailable at this time.

What if I have a problem or can’t apply my patch?
-------------------------------------------------
We’re here to support you.  If you have any issues, give us a shout.
